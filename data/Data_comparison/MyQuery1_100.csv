4816756;method and system for indoor geolocation using an impulse response fingerprinting technique;the location of people, mobile terminals and equipment in a mine is of great current interest. in an indoor environment such as a mine (may be generalised to any indoor environment), the multipath caused by reflection from walls, ceiling, floor and objects, and the non-line of sight (nlos) due to the blockage of the shortes t direct path between the transmitter and receiver are the main sources of range measurement errors. the unreliable measurements of location metrics such as rss, aoa and toa/tdoa yield to the deterioration of the positioning performanc e. hence, alternatives to the traditional parametric geolocation techniques hav e to be considered. in this paper, we present a novel method for mobile station location using wideband channel measurements' results applied to an artificial neural network (ann). the proposed system (wbnn-locate) learns off-line the location 'signatures' from the extracted location dependent features of the measured channel impulse responses data (any relevant location dependent parameter may also be used) for los an d nlos situations. it then matches on-line the observation received from a mobile station against the learned set of 'signatures' to accurately locate its position. with this approach, multipath becomes useful since it improves location 'signatures' characterisation, and the presence of a line of sight (los) is no longer essential, unlike in other geolocation techniques. the proposed location system has the characteristic to operate with a single fixed station and may be applied to a three-dimensional environment. the error median distance and the 90th percentile of the error distance foun d with this technique were 1.2 m and 2 m, respectively.
