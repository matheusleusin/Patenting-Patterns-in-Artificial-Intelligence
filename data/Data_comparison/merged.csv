442239;"open information extraction from the web";"to implement open information extraction, a new extraction paradigm has been developed in which a system makes a single data-driven pass over a corpus of text, extracting a large set of relational tuples without requiring any human input. using training data, a self-supervised learner employs a parser and heuristics to determine criteria that will be used by an extraction classifier (or other ranking model) for evaluating the trustworthiness of candidate tuples that have been extracted from the corpus of text, by applying heuristics to the corpus of text. the classifier retains tuples with a sufficiently high probability of being trustworthy. a redundancy-based assessor assigns a probability to each retained tuple to indicate a likelihood that the retained tuple is an actual instance of a relationship between a plurality of objects comprising the retained tuple. the retained tuples comprise an extraction graph that can be queried for information.";"Yes"
4798264;"audioptical vortex replication transdigitator";"you are embarking on a journey not unlike that of columbus. a discovery of a new frontier so vast and so primitive that it will overwhelm your senses. it is an impending birth of a new technology. a technology that will propel our planet and societies to new heights of grandeur and achievement unlike anything else ever before witnessed by our species. but like all new births, we must now prepare ourselves to take care of this unborn technological embryo. we must prepare a formulae to feed and nourish her to insure her growth is a strong and healthy one. this formulae must consist of a mixture of fiber audio-optical light waves, electric impulses, and a fyberfonic frequency. contained within this formulae will be all the nutrien ts and ingredients to evolve this technological embryo from infancy to quantum childhood. to evolv e her to the level of ai (artificial intelligence). to build a quantum computer platform where her ai can grow and mature. her first step will begin where einstein's e = mc2 left off. it will begin with avort. not the next step, but the next leap...!";"Unclear"
